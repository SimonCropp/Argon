/// <summary>
/// Converter which does nothing but delegate to another one for all operations.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Nothing in this class is specific to Noda Time. Its purpose is to make it easy
/// to reuse other converter instances with <see cref="JsonConverterAttribute"/>,
/// which can only identify a converter by type.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// <para>
/// If you had some <see cref="LocalDate"/> properties which needed one converter,
/// but others that needed another, you might want to have different types implementing
/// those converters. Each type would just derive from this, passing the right converter
/// into the base constructor.
